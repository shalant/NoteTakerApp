 //frank's to do list
 // - back end routes ( ie /api/notes or //api anything)
    // create, read, update or delete data in db. 
      // - do the task and then send back the data

//from askBCS: 
//1. Via the express route, you need to send the server the id of the note to be deleted 
//   (using req params would be easiest)
//2. Within the routes, you'll need to read the "db". In this assignment,
//   a json file is used as a stand-in for a database. You're already reading a using the db in your GET route
//3. Next is the tricky part, you have the whole database and the record to be deleted. What methods do you have
//   at your disposal to filter out new data from old given a condition?
//4. Once you have a new array with all but the record that was "deleted" the rewrite that new array as db.json
//5. Send a response back to the front end like a 200 code or success message
//   so the client know the delete was a success

// Routes:
//I need to set up 5: GET:'/notes', GET'*', GET'/api/notes', POST'/api/notes', DELETE'/api/notes/:id'

//#1: GET 'notes'

//#2 is the last one- a "catch-all" SO SCROLL TO THE END


//Q for askBCS: in #4, how to i add newNote to db.json?
//Q for askBCS: how do i give a note an id?

//#3 GET '/api/notes'



    //#4 POST '/api/notes'
//POST `/api/notes` - Should receive a new note to save on the request body,
//add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.
